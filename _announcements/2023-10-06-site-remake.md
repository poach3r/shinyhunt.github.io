# Introduction

I've been ignoring this site for a few months now (mostly due to being *very* busy this summer and lacking ideas) and have decided to remake the site and it's articles to both reduce the size of the site (its currently sitting at 140mbs) and the quality of the site.

# The Plan

Over the next few weeks I will be going through the process of rewriting all existsing articles. Afterwards, I plan on writing a new article at least once a month. I also plan on implementing some SEO.

Note: The site will likely be down for a bit.

# Why?

Some of my takes haven't aged the best and **many** of my articles lack consistency with each other. The information presented in these articles is also rather poor and could be explored far better.
