# Theming

## Overview:

All themes are stored in `./themes/`. Inside this folder, you will have `theme.txt`, `default.txt`, and `tokyo-night.txt`. `theme.txt` is where you declare the active theme, `default.txt` is the default theme, and `tokyo-night.txt` is my personal theme.

## Creating a Theme:

1. Create a new text file in `./themes/`
2. Paste the background color's hex code on line 1
3. Paste the text color's hex code on line 2
4. Paste the border color's hex code on line 3
5. Open `theme.txt` and replace `default` with the name of your theme
