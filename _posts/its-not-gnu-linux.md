I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as GNU/Linux, is in fact, not GNU/Linux, it is a large stack of programs built on top of the Linux Kernel and does not even require GNU. The use of GNU/Linux is completely idiotic as there is a large amount of programs built on top of the Linux Kernel, not simply GNU. There are also replacements for GNU, for example a Linux user could instead use BusyBox if they so desired. The copypasta is overused, unfunny, and untrue, and I'm tired of seeing it.
